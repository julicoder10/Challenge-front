# Challenge-front

--- PROS ---
Good naming conventions
It works and logic looks good
Usage of Grid & Flexbox
Media queries, although not super complete, are there
Good usage of realtive units such as REM
Good commenting, maybe too much
Good handling of intervals

--- CONS --- 
Board should be a matrix not a single dimension array, to better represent reality.
Missing usage of SCSS
Missing TS
No BEM practices
We loose comments completely on the piece and timer components
